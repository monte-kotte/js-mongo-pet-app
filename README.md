# Pet Management App

## Description

This is a **Pet Management App** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. It provides users with the ability to manage a collection of pets. This app supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for pets, which includes storing and managing information like `name`, `type`, and `age`.

## Set Up MongoDB Using Docker

To run MongoDB locally using Docker, we use **Docker Compose**. Ensure that Docker is installed on your system.

  docker-compose up -d

  # Check Running Containers. 
  # You should see your MongoDB container (`pet-app-mongo`) in the output.
  docker ps

  # Stop the MongoDB container and clean up the resources.
  docker-compose down
```

  npm start
```
